# **Phishing Email Detection Using Machine Learning**

This project builds a phishing email detection system using machine learning techniques. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text vectorization and Random Forest classifier (or any other ML model) for classification. The goal is to detect whether an email is a phishing email or legitimate based on its content.

## **Project Overview**

This project detects phishing emails using machine learning. It involves several steps, including preprocessing raw email data, training a model using a labeled dataset, and using that model to predict whether new emails are phishing or legitimate.

---

## **Features**
- **Email Classification**: Classify emails into "Phishing" or "Not Phishing" based on their content.
- **Text Preprocessing**: The raw email text is converted into a feature vector using TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- **Prediction**: Predict whether a new email is phishing based on the trained model.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Flask** (optional): Can be used to deploy the model as a web service.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
